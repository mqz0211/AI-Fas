Project Description
This project showcases a modern web application leveraging Artificial Intelligence to transform the fashion industry. It features an interactive platform where users can explore AI-generated fashion concepts and receive personalized styling advice powered by a large language model. The website emphasizes a seamless user experience with smooth animations and a responsive design across various devices.

Features
Dynamic Hero Section: Engaging introduction with animated text and a subtle parallax image effect.

Our Vision & The Process Sections: Informative content sections with scroll-triggered animations (GSAP) to guide the user through the project's goals and methodology.

AI-Themed Fashion Gallery: A visual showcase of innovative fashion concepts, featuring (placeholder or AI-generated) garment designs.

Interactive AI Styling Advisor: A core functionality allowing users to input their fashion queries and receive creative, practical styling advice from an integrated AI model.

Responsive Design: Optimized for a smooth viewing experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Smooth Navigation: Utilizes GSAP's ScrollToPlugin for animated smooth scrolling to different sections.

Technologies Used
Frontend Framework: React.js

Styling: Tailwind CSS (for utility-first CSS and responsive design)

Animations: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) - including ScrollTrigger and ScrollToPlugin

AI Integration: Google Gemini API (specifically gemini-2.0-flash for text generation)

JavaScript Libraries: Standard DOM APIs for interactive elements and logic.

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Local Development Setup
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project from your GitHub repository:

git clone YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE
cd Ai-Fas
# Navigate into your project directory

(Replace YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE with the HTTPS or SSH URL of your GitHub repository)

2. Install Dependencies
Install all the necessary Node.js packages:

npm install
or if you use yarn
yarn install

4. Run the Application
Start the development server:

For Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):
```CMD
SET NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider && npm start
```
For macOS/Linux (Terminal):
```Terminal
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider && npm start
```
This command ensures compatibility with older react-scripts versions and OpenSSL if you encounter "digital envelope routines::unsupported" errors.

The application will typically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Website Demonstration
To see the website in action, please follow these steps after setting up the project locally:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or whatever address your terminal provides).

Explore the Homepage: Observe the layout, header, and initial animations.

Navigate Sections: Use the navigation menu or scroll down to see "Our Vision," "The Process," and the "Gallery."

Test the AI Styling Advisor:

Scroll to the "AI Styling Advisor" section.

Enter a query in the text area (e.g., "Suggest a formal outfit for a winter gala," or "What should I wear for a casual beach day?").

Click the "Get AI Styling Advice" button and observe the loading state and the generated advice.
